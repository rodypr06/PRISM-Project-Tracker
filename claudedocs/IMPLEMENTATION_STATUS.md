## Notes for Future Sessions

- All core functionality from CLAUDE.md implemented

- Consider adding more advanced MagicUI components for enhanced visuals
- The "Client View Preview" feature gives admins confidence before client delivery
- Sequential task progression is visual only (not enforced by backend)
- Database is SQLite file-based (easy backup: just copy database.sqlite)
