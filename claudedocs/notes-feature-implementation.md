  project_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_markdown BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
)
```

### note_attachments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE note_attachments (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  note_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  original_filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  mime_type TEXT NOT NULL,
